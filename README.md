# In following repo, documenting the learning required for blockchain in 2025

## what is blockchain : 
- Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital ledger **(Imagine a ledger as a diary, but for your money. It's a record of all your financial transaction)** consisting of records called blocks that are used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks. This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.   

## Key characteristics of blockchain:

Decentralization: No single entity controls the blockchain. It is distributed across a network of computers.   

Immutability: Once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted.   
Transparency: All transactions are publicly visible and verifiable.   

Security: Cryptography ensures the security of transactions and data.

## How does it work?

Transactions: Users initiate transactions, such as sending cryptocurrency or recording ownership of an asset.   

Verification: Nodes on the network verify the transaction's validity.  

Block creation: Verified transactions are grouped into blocks.   

Blockchain addition: The new block is added to the existing chain of blocks, creating a chronological record.


## Networks in blockchain : 
In the context of blockchain, a **network** refers to the interconnected system of computers (or nodes) that work together to maintain and operate the blockchain. 

Think of it like this:

* **Blockchain as the Library:** The blockchain itself is like a giant, decentralized library where all the financial transactions are recorded.
* **Network as the Librarians:** The network is made up of all the computers (nodes) that help manage this library. They:
    * **Verify transactions:** They check if transactions are valid and follow the rules of the blockchain.
    * **Maintain the ledger:** They store and update the blockchain with new transactions.
    * **Ensure security:** They use cryptography to protect the data and prevent tampering.

**Key points about blockchain networks:**

* **Decentralized:** No single entity controls the network. It's distributed among many computers.
* **Distributed ledger:** Each node in the network has a copy of the entire blockchain.
* **Consensus mechanism:** The network uses a set of rules (consensus mechanism) to agree on the order of transactions and maintain consistency.

**Types of Blockchain Networks:**

* **Public:** Anyone can join and participate in the network. (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum)
* **Private:** Access to the network is restricted to authorized members. (e.g., enterprise blockchains)
* **Consortium:** A mix of public and private, where a group of organizations controls the network.

**In essence, the network is the backbone of a blockchain, enabling its decentralized and secure operation.**
